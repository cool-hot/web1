  Floral design or flower arrangement</a> is the <strong>art of using <u>plant materials
  and flowers</u></strong> to create a pleasing and balanced composition. Evidence of

  art of using plant materials and flowers to create a pleasing and
  balanced composition. Evidence of refined floristry is found as far back as the culture
  of ancient Egypt. Professionally designed floral designs, arrangements or artwork
  incorporate the elements of floral design: line, form, space, texture, and color,
  and the principles of floral design: balance, proportion, rhythm, contrast, harmony,
  and unity.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:35px;">There are many styles of floral design including Botanical Style, Garden Style, Crescent
  Corsage, Nosegay Corsage, Pot au Fleur, Inverted "T", Parallel Systems, Western Line,
  Hedgerow Design, Mille de Fleur, and Formal Linear.</p><p>The Eastern, Western, and European styles
  have all influenced the commercial floral industry as it is today. Ikebana is a Japanese style of
  floral design, and incorporates the three main line placements of heaven, human, and earth.
  In contrast, the European style emphasizes color and variety of botanical materials not limited to
  just blooming flowers, in mass gatherings of multiple flowers. Western design historically is
  characterized by symmetrical,asymmetrical, horizontal, and vertical style of arrangements.</p>
  <p>In addition to flower arrangements, floral design includes making wreaths, nosegays,
  garlands, festoons, boutonnieres, corsages, and bows.</p>
